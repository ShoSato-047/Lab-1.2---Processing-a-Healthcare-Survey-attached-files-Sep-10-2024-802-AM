# Lab-1.2---Processing_a_Healthcare_Survey-
***This is a lab notebook from DSCI 326 lab 1.2.***

In this lab, health care survey results from the Statistical Consulting Center at WSU were processed. 
The stack-transform-unstack technique was performed using `Polars` to reverse code the survey results for the future data analysis with the clients. 

The original data and output csv files are in the Data folder.
